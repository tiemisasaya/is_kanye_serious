# Is Kanye serious?

As a Kanye West's fan since 2010, I've defended his actions through the years with reasonable arguments. But in recent history, it has been way harder. People say he does outrageous things for attention, to get us to listen to his music. Often the question of "Is he serious?" pop up. 

This analysis has the purpose of using data to help me make my arguments solid. 

### Questions that i hope are answered:
- Does his dramatic statements help him in album sales?
- Do the outrageous events actually gave a boost in music success ou just negative popularity?

### Data used
- Billboard API
- Twitter API
